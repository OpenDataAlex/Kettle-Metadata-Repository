Kettle Metadata Repository
------------------------------------------

The Kettle Metadata Repository is intended to fill a gap in that there are not that
many Metadata Repository tools available to the open source community.  The backend
work is being built in Pentaho's Kettle, a versitile ETL tool.  The frontend is
being built with the Symfony PHP Framework.  Utilising both tools allows for great
flexibility without sacrificing the end goals of the project.

The goal of KMR is to provide a central repository for metadata information.
Metadata is usually defined as 'data about data' and while technically true,
it requires a touch of refinement.  Metadata is the definitions, relationships,
and usage of a given piece of data.  For the purposes of this project, this
will be further defined as:

1)  How the data is defined within the system that is storing it (i.e. column type, 
    definition entered in the database, etc.).
2)  What is being stored for the given data (i.e. minimum and maximum values, 
    distinct values, other quality statistics, etc.).
3)  Business definitions for the data
4)  How the data is utilized in the business (i.e. how the data moves from a
    source system through to the data warehouse, data marts, and finally to
    end user solutions.
